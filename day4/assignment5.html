		The freshers' party was exactly the thing we needed. The thing is , our life is quite monotonous. And after a time you are mentally exhausted , you need a change, and the party was the perfect solution!....it started with a long round of Photosessions and selfies of us, well dressed. As everyone was bleaming in an unparalleled Aura and Excitement was at peak ,it didn't take much for us settle in that ambience.
